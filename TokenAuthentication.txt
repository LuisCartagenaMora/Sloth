Sequence of Token Authentication Process:

1) The user attempts to register by filling out the Register Form. (1)
2) When the request is submitted, the user's credentials are stored
in the postressql db. in order...(5a)(4a)
3) When the user logs in they create a Login request. (2)
4) If the user is successfully authenticated a token is created.
This token expires after 24 hours. in order... (5b)(4b)(6)(3)
5) Once the user is authenticated they are able to access their
expenses.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1) RegisterResponse.java- A Register Request is created by the user 
			  (firstname, lastname, username, and 
                          password).

2) AuthenticationRequest.java- An Authentication(Login) Request is 
			       created by the user (username and 
			       password).

3) AuthenticationResponse.java- If the user is successfully 
			         authenticated they are provided a 
				 token which expires after 24 hours.

4) AuthenticationService.java- Provides two functions:
  4a) register(request)- accepts the users register request 
     			and saves it to the repository(postgressql). 
			Afterwards, the users token is created.
  4b) authenticate()

5) AuthenticationController.java- Provides two endpoints:
  5a) @PostMapping("/register")- Extracts the request body(the 
     				information in the Register Form) 
				and passes it as the 
     				parameter for the register function.

  5b) @PostMapping("/authenticate")- Extracts the request body(the 
     				    information in the Login Form) 
				    and passes it as the parameter
     				    for the authenticate function.

6) JwtService.java- Provides helper functions(e.j. generateToken(), 
                 isTokenValid(), etc.) for generating the token
                 and verfying if the generated token has expired.

7) CustomUserDetailsService.java- Provides a single helper function
                               which fetches the user via their 
			       username.
